# Various scripts I've created to get work done!
### I have miscellaneous one-off purpose-built scripts or code snips in this repo. If you find anything here useful, I'm a happier person because of it. Also, this gives me a handy place to store my own code for reuse. 

* ADAccountReport.ps1 - Traverse your Active Directory domain starting at a search base DN of your choice, and output a handy CSV file of user account information.

* ExchangeMailboxReport.ps1 - Connect to an Exchange server and output a handy CSV of mailbox data. Change Recipient Type to search room or shared mailboxes instead.

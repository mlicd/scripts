# Various scripts I've created to get work done!

* ADAccountReport.ps1 - Traverse your Active Directory domain starting at a search base DN of your choice, and output a handy CSV file of user account information.

* ExchangeMailboxReport.ps1 - Connect to an Exchange server and output a handy CSV of mailbox data. Change Recipient Type to search room or shared mailboxes instead.
